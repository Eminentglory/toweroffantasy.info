                <h1 class="mt-4"><strong>Armor</strong></h1>
                Armor improves your combat effectiveness through passive stat increases, and can be obtained through various dungeons and shops.<br>
                Each piece of armor has fixed stats, which increase through <strong>Enhancement</strong>, and random stats, which increase through <strong>Fusion</strong>.<br>
                <div class="text-center">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/armor/helmet.png">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/armor/shoulder.png">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/armor/arm.png">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/armor/top.png">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/armor/gloves.png">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/armor/belt.png">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/armor/bottom.png">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/armor/shoes.png">
                </div>
                <h3><strong>Enhancement</strong></h3>
                Enhancement will add a + sign on your armor, increasing the fixed stats of that piece. Every 5th enhancement (+5, +10, +15...) is a breakthrough level--when all of your pieces reach that level, you will receive bonus stats. How high you can enhance your equipment is limited by your character level.<br>
                <div class="text-center">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/mat/armor1.png">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/coin/gold.png">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/mat/armor2.png">
                </div>
                You will need Enhancement Modules and Gold, and breakthrough levels require Superior Modules as well.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Enhancement level will carry over when replacing armor</strong>, given that you don't discard the item it was last attached to. In other words, if you have +10 on your current gloves, you can equip a new pair of gloves and they will also be +10. Think of it as enhancing the slot where they are equipped. Be careful though, if you choose to unequip an enhanced armor piece (without replacing), it is possible to dismantle the enhanced one.<br>
                <br>
                <h3><strong>Fusion</strong></h3>
                Fusion will add stars on your armor, increasing one random stat per star. The rarity of your armor will determine how many stars it can have, and how much EXP is required to level it up.<br>
                <div class="text-center">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/mat/exp1.png">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/mat/exp2.png">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/mat/exp3.png">
                </div>
                You will need EXP crystals, which can be obtained from breaking the large crystal veins in the overworld and through various shops. You can also use armor copies of the same piece (i.e. feed pants into pants) or dismantle the armor into crystals--it will give half the EXP if you dismantle it.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Fusion stars will NOT carry over between pieces</strong>, meaning new armor will have to be leveled up from the beginning. You can use previously starred armor for EXP, though it will not give 100% of the EXP you spent to reach that star (it's something like base EXP of that armor + 70-80% I think). Meaning feeding a 5 star armor into a brand new one will result in 4 stars + some EXP.<br>
                <div class="text-center">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/armor/core_orange_fire.png">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/armor/core_orange_ice.png">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/armor/core_orange_physic.png">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/armor/core_orange_thunder.png">
                </div>
                Arc Cores are a unique piece of armor acquired through 8-player raids. You must use materials rewarded from these raids for fusion on them--armor and EXP crystals will not work.<br>
                <br>
                <h1 class="mt-4"><strong>Weapons</strong></h1>
                Weapons can be obtained through the various gacha banners in the game, through world bosses, and potentially through events. They can be upgraded with duplicate copies which add stars, and through leveling them up.<br>
                <br>
                <h3><strong>Upgrading</strong></h3>
                Leveling a weapon consumes Weapon Batteries to provide EXP to the weapon. Every level will provide stat increases to that weapon, and every 10 levels will increase its damage multiplier for attacks. Every 10 levels you will need breakthrough materials to raise the level cap further.<br>
                <div class="text-center">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/mat/red1.png">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/mat/green1.png">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/mat/blue1.png">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/mat/black1.png">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/mat/fire1.png">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/mat/ice1.png">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/mat/physical1.png">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/mat/electric1.png">
                </div>
                Weapon breakthrough materials can be obtained through dungeons, events, battle pass, overworld veins (elemental materials only) and shops. The required materials increase as the weapon level increases. How high you can level your weapon is limited by your character level.<br>
                <br>
                <h3><strong>Awakening</strong></h3>
                Using duplicate copies will add stars to your current weapon, unlocking powerful effects and considerably increasing its stats.<br>
                <div class="text-center">
                    <img style="width: 64px" src="images/mat/weapon_star.png">
                </div>
                The max stars is 6, so with the base copy you will need to pull a weapon 7 times to max it out. Subsequent copies will be converted into 10 Black Market Tokens.

                    This guide will go over each of the weapons briefly, to help players figure out what weapons might interest them in the coming global release of Tower of Fantasy.
                    <h2 class="mt-4"><strong>Weapon Breakdown</strong></h2>
                    <p>
                        To begin with there are weapon types, weapon archetypes, and weapon roles. Weapon types and archetypes are defined in game, while roles would be the value they bring to your build. The weapon types would be bow, scythe, dual guns, and so on, however this isn’t really important. I believe the weapon archetype and role to be the more important in choosing what weapons you want to bring, as we will see in some theoretical builds later in this guide.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="mt-4"><strong>Weapon Archetype</strong></h2>
                    <p>
                        There are 3 different weapon archetypes in ToF: <strong style="color: var(--color-red)">Attacker</strong>, <strong style="color: var(--color-clay)">Tank</strong>, and <strong style="color: var(--color-turquoise)">Support</strong>.
                        <br><br>
                        Equipping 1 of each archetype results in the balanced resonance. This gives you a 5% boost to damage and damage reduction when solo. In team play or coop this is a 20% increase to shield break efficiency and healing, as well as a 25% increase to damage and damage reduction.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong style="color: var(--color-red)">Attacker</strong> is primarily damage focused weapons, where having 2 or more equipped will give you the attack resonance. This gives you a 10% damage boost in solo play, and a 40% damage boost in team play.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong style="color: var(--color-clay)">Tank</strong> is primarily shield break/shields/damage reduction focused weapons where equipping 2 or more will give you the tank resonance. This gives you a 800% aggro buff and 25% damage reduction in solo play, and a 800% aggro buff with 45% damage reduction in team play.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong style="color: var(--color-turquoise)">Support</strong> is primarily healing and buff focused weapons, where having 2 or more equipped gives you the support resonance. This gives you a 100% increase to outgoing heals in solo play, and a 200% increase in team play.
                        <br><br>
                        Let's take a look at each character's weapon.

                        Her weapon is a lightning element Tang Dao, her roles would be shield break and dps. This is good to have in your build so u can break shields, and interrupt boss skills, as well as having iframes for safety. I would at minimum use her at 1★ for the dmg boost, preferably at least 3★ for the shield break dmg.

                        His weapon is a physical Mech suit with a swap skill to enter his robot. He has defensive shields, offensive buffs, and great energy recharge. This helps to cast more switch skills while drastically increasing survivability and boosting offensive capabilities. At minimum I would use him at 1★ for the survivability, however 3★ optimally for the 35% dmg boost.

                        Her weapon is an ice element bow. Her roles fall under offensive buffs, and great energy recharge. This helps with ranged dps providing safety as well as boosting offensive capabilities and providing fast energy gain. I would at minimum use her at 1★ for the 24% dmg buff, however the buff easier to maintain at 3★, stronger at 6★

                        His weapon is a fire cube. He provides heals, offensive buffs, and shields, as well as a decent recharge rate. This helps increase survivability while also boosting offensive capabilities. He is also the only non macro option for afk farming <s>gotta afk farm those mount parts and honey for foods</s> I would at minimum use him at 1★ for the heals.

                        His weapon is a fire scythe. His roles are shield break. While he may primarily only do one thing, its quite important. At 1★ when breaking he provides a strong dot(damage over time) effect. This enables you to break shields easily, get the DoT, and swap to a stronger dps weapon. I would at minimum use him at 1★ for the break DoT.

                        Her weapons are physical chakrams. She also fills the shield break role. At 3★ she provides a full skill cd reset. This enables crazy combos and has great utility but decent investment as well. I would at minimum use her at 3★ for the free skill cd reset.

                        Her weapon is an ice staff. Her role is healing, buff support, and recharge. This helps increase survivability as well as boost offensive capabilities. As a wise man once said, dead dps is no dps. At minimum I would use her at 1★ for the hp and energy regen over time.

                        Her weapon is an ice claymore. Her role is shield break, cc immune, shields. This enables her to quickly take down shields, as well as keep you alive without being thd-flexn around. I would at minimum use her at 1★ for the increased shield break power, as well as the self sustain.

This enables him to provide high crit rate as well as boost lightning dmg without being thrown around while also doing significant dmg himself. At minimum I would use him at 3★ for the significant dmg boost it provides(30% when target below 60% hp).

                        Her weapon is a fire shotgun. Her role is dps. This enables her to shred down bosses and handle the fight before things get messy. I would at minimum use her at 6★ because without it, her skill cd is far too long to be worth using.

                        Her weapon is physical sword(katana). Her role is aerial dps and offensive buffs. This enables her to buff other weapons, and increase skill dmg at 5★ while doing decent dmg herself. I would at minimum use her at 1★ for the 24% dmg buff.

                        Her weapon is electric dual guns. Her role is aerial dps, decent recharge. She is special in that she attacks in the air but above enemies keeping you relatively safe, while doing massive dmg. At minimum I would use her at 0★, not that her stars aren’t good, but she is simply that good at base.

                        Her weapon is fire shield. Her role is debuff, stun, dmg reduction. This enables her to neutralize enemies effectively, while providing decent recharge. At minimum I would use her at 0★ because her dupes while useful, aren’t really game breaking in regards to her role.

This enables her to boost lightning dmg significantly, whole also healing and dealing lightning dmg while using another weapon. I would use her at 1★ minimum for the heals, and extra sustain. 3★ however adds DoT.

                        On my main I typically use Crow, Tsubasa, and Marc. This is by no means optimal, especially because I lack 2p Claudia chip but I will get into that in another guide as chips play a significant role when it comes to the effectiveness of a build. <span class="fst-italic">The hardships of a f2p…</span>. The concept of this build was to boost my energy recharge with Marc and Tsubasa, enabling me to spam Crow’s switch skill. At the same time Tsubasa buffs my attack damage, and doubles as a DoT when I need it. In addition Marc boosts survivability via his shields (and with dupes he can buff attack damage as well). In summary, it becomes a balancing act between offensive buffs, survivability and raw damage. Crow is kind of a special case as in most other cases you want to break shield, he simply spams his “plunge” attack regardless. Because this requires finesse it’s preferable to do this on pc, with two examples provided below.
                        <br><br>
                        <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1NL411T7Np">DPS Showcase 1</a>
                        <br>
                        <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1K44y1n7N7">DPS Showcase 2</a>
                        <br><br>
                        On my alt, I plan on using Bai, Tsubasa, Claudia. This is far more optimal as it has most of what you look for in an offensive oriented build. While this build may lack shields and survivability, it has dmg, dmg, and more dmg. Bai handles the heavy lifting, shield break as well as having iframes during her active skill. Tsubasa and Claudia both are used to charge energy for bai to spam her QTE, while also buffing dmg. With Tsubasa giving a 40% dmg buff, and Claudia giving 24% as well, in solo play bosses get shredded, and in team play you can carry dps. While it may not be as forgiving as builds with some survivability, it makes up for it with dmg output. As of now I don’t have Claudia and am not willing to invest in another third weapon for now because as a f2p, its already hard enough to get dupes of a weapon if you want to stay on a competitive level.
                        <br><br>
                        A more balanced dps build can output even more however. One example of this is Marc, Nemesis, Samir. While Marc really wants dupes to grant his damage buff and provide more shields, it truly is worth the cost. Nemesis in this case provides DoT, Heals, and energy, while Marc basically ensures u don’t die with his shields. Nemesis also provides a strong lightning buff, as marc provides an damage buff. Samir in this case provides energy as well as the big dmg. Samir attacks safely from the air keeping you out of harms way helping boost survivability as well, not to mention how many switch skills you would be able to spam with such a comp.
                        <br><br>
                        The best early game whale dps build is Samir, Tsubasa, King. This is because King offers shield break, as well as DoT off his shield break. King also happens to be one of two options for attack role shield break, the other being Shiro. Tsubasa gives a 40% dmg buff as well as charges energy for switch skills. Samir carries dmg while safely attacking from the air. It also helps that this is a tri-elemental build so there is always the option of using a non-resisted weapon.
                        <br><br>
                        The best DPS build as of current consists of 6★ Bai Yuekui, Marc, and Nemesis. Bai breaks shields while having a very strong dodge attack and the highest damage in game as of now. Marc grants a 35% damage buff as well as shields making one almost invincible. Nemesis provides a strong 50% lightning damage buff, as well as a powerful DoT effect often healing more than pure support healers.

                    <p>
                        Much of the utility each weapon can provide highly depends on the amount of dupes you can get on the weapon. As such it’s important to know what you want to work with as a free to play. Personally, this ended up with me giving Tsubasa a lot of value because she provides a strong damage buff, as well as energy to charge switch skills more often.
                        <br><br>
                        DPS isn’t all that matters however. Even if it generally is the best way to clear solo content for a couple of reasons:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>solo content will want you to have more damage though, survivability is also valued</li>
                        <li>ded DPS is no DPS--<span class="fst-italic">the same applies to bosses</span></li>
                        <li>some content just hits too hard--optimal gameplay would require good dodges resulting in rarely any damage taken, so going all attack often fares better</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This is in addition to things like Marc that enable a damage focused set up to boast strong survivability as well. As such tanking is generally not optimal because of mechanics (tanks lose out damage just from resonance, in addition to what weapons are available and how much damage each provides). Simply put, in this game tanks have an aggro buff and damage reduction, but if a DPS can maintain aggro through their damage while avoiding damage, wouldn’t a good DPS just outperform a tank? Yes. All of this still doesn’t discount the value tanks have. In specific end game content such as frontier clash (Hard) the boost tanks get in breaking power is what you need to prevent annoying mechanics such as enemies taking flight. We all know how annoying a boss that jumps across the map can be, especially when you have long cooldowns.
                        <br><br>
                        A good tank build could easily be Marc, Meryl, and Tsubasa. Meryl has the best breaking power as of now, as well as cc immunity already proving her worth in this comp. Her switch skill can also trap enemies, thought it’ll trap your allies as well… She also does decent damage with her spin attack. Marc provides shield, energy, and an attack buff, as well as cc immunity. Tsubasa provides ranged damage, DoT, and energy recharge to spam more switch skills.

                    <h2 class="mt-5"><strong>Support</strong></h2>
                    <p>
                        Healer builds will typically want to run shield break to prevent boss ultimate abilities, but they can run full support as well. As there are only 4 support weapons a good build would be 2 from Zero/Nemesis/Coco, and a Shiro/Meryl. Zero provides shields as well has offensive buffs and heals to the party. He has a party wide 3 sec iframe, and charges switch skills too. Nemesis has DoT from 3★ and HoT from 1★, while Coco has offensive buffs and cc immune from 3★, and a strong burst heal. At high stars Nemesis even offers noticeable damage which could be a good option for healer mains. Meryl has the strongest breaking power while Shiro active skill boosts shield break efficiency and damage for party. She also has a skill cd reset when she breaks enemies shields from 3★.

                        Deal the highest damage to shields. Necessary as most bosses and minibosses have shields that significantly reduce damage taken. Bosses will also use powerful attacks if their shield is not broken in time. These weapons tend to unlock a crucial shield break effect at 1★ or 3★.

                <p>
                    This guide will go over some of the more notable and prevalent chips, their uses, and some explanations as to why these chips stand out in comparison to others. We will focus on chips present on the standard banner. This is because most of your black crystals(granted your on a budget) will be going into weapon banners rather than chips. Standard chips are able to cover most of the roles you would want, while also being easier to obtain and star up, leading to higher base stats.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2><strong>Chip Breakdown</strong></h2>
                <p>
                    As of now we know that <strong class="tier-a">SR chips have a level cap of 70</strong>. <strong class="tier-s">SSR chips can exceed 70</strong>, but because we have a soft cap of level 70 for now, we don’t know the level cap on SSR chips. This is notable because beyond level 70 SSR chips (which already give more stats than SR chips) also have a higher level cap giving them even more of an edge. This however, doesn’t mean that SR chips are always worse than SSR chips because the set effects you receive by fulfilling certain requirements contribute far more to your build. You wouldn’t want to exchange a 6% unconditional increase to lightning damage, for a 15% increase to lightning damage when healed (if you don’t heal). In addition, R chips only have a 4p/4 piece/4 set effect, while SR have a 3p/3 piece/3 set effect. With these you only get one possible effect depending on the set. SSR sets have both 2p and 4p effects, so you can mix and match 2p effects to better suit your build, as this offers much more flexibility.

                        <blockquote class="m-0 mt-2">Crow 2p is great for DPS, as optimally you want to build for crit and will have no trouble hitting crits consistently. He provides a strong crit damage buff with an easy condition to maintain as its reliant on enemy hp. His 4p, however is bleed which generally isn’t good. Bleed effects are dot per sec, and don’t scale with attack buffs so it ends up being better to buff attack directly, especially when u can deal dmg multiple times in a second.</blockquote>

Samir 4p isn’t considered worth using despite the additional damage. Her 4p adds a 10%+ damage additional hit, however it only applies to the target (meaning the enemy targeted, meaning 1 additional attack). While it may be good for bosses, there are options like Crow 2p that would provide universal benefits regardless of the content (bosses vs mobs).</blockquote>

It’s great for shield break weapons because it boosts their utility, often giving the edge you need to prevent bosses from triggering their ults. Her 4p however falls off because a 20%+ damage boost upon entering combat is not enough to outweigh a universal damage boost, especially when you consider set up time, and content where fights last over 40 seconds.</blockquote>

Afterall is there any point in reflecting 100k damage when you can do that much with ease from strictly going DPS? However, if a boss hits you for 2m, it suddenly becomes far more worth to reflect half of that back. This creates an issue however since you have to take that 2m damage still to reflect it, since there is no point if you die. This is where zero comes in. His switch skill provides the party with a 3 second invincibility-frame. That is, free reflect damage, when timed properly. When switching off this weapons, you get a damage buff for 5 seconds, minimal but useful.</blockquote>

                As you can see, this list only has standard chips as well as Claudia, because generally it isn’t worth to pull on limited chips when most of your resources will be going towards weapons. Whales however, are able to get limited chips maxed but guide isn’t geared towards whales. Chips also have dupes which increase the values on their set effects, which makes standard chips even more worth it. There are also no tank chips present because, tanking as a role already covers anything you might want as a tank, and shield breaking is the biggest thing a tank should focus on apart from survivability (which shouldn’t be reliant on chips). This leaves the rest of the chips for support, DPS, or even niches such as reflect dmg which tanks may love.

                    You can create 3 relic sets that you can swap with the <kbd>G</kbd> key (on PC). You can't swap sets while <i>in</i> combat, but who says you can't swap <i>before</i> combat? Relics like Spacetime Rift, Drone, Couant, Magnetic Storm, Hovering Cannon, Type V Armor (for the explosion after ejecting), and Missile Barrage can be useful even when activated just before an enemy spawns, such as in Bygone Phantasm or Frontier Clash. Make use of this to maximize your DPS.<br><br>
                    
                    Weapon sets can also be made, but there's no shortcut to swap them (on PC press <kbd>N</kbd> to quickly open the menu). You can swap while out of combat to quickly heal up (i.e. between waves in Frontier Clash or before a dungeon boss) or if you need to switch weapons. Matrices cannot be changed inside dungeon instances.

                    This can vary per weapon, but in general aerial attacks do more damage. On the other hand, they leave you more vulnerable, consume endurance, and sometimes will get you caught in a cat-and-mouse chase with a moving enemy, so only aerial attack in certain situations, like when a boss is facing another player.

Double jumping before casting Discharge skills can help you avoid most enemy attacks.

                    If you don't break a boss' shield, they will use an ultimate of their own, which, depending on the boss, can be ignored or can be completely lethal to your team. In either case, shields reduce the damage you deal to the enemy and usually there are some juicy shield break buffs and effects that are worth pursuing, so switch to your shield break weapon and mash that left click.

However, <strong>you can actually just tap the interact key and dash away</strong>, and they will still be revived.

You can play the claw machine 3 times a day and earn gifts that raise simulacra affinity/friendship. The prizes you can get are fixed, but the purple fox is a purple tier gift. I'm not sure if the black robot cat (another purple tier) is even grabbable as it always slips out of the claw.<br><br>
                    
                    Another opportunity for free gifts is at the NPC Hopkins, found at the Black Market (near the world boss Apophis). Speak to him and you will be presented with a choice between two mystery boxes. There is a chance of getting purple tier gifts from this daily.

                    <strong class="text-green">Up to 4-player dungeon that rewards Gold</strong><br>

                    Dimensional trials are a source of gold and consist of up to 4 players running through an instance that rotates everyday. If the timer expires or all 4 players die the instance will close. Everyday there is a rotating buff that enemies within the instance can receive.<br>
                    <img src="images/cn.svg"> Additional difficulties that give much more gold were added.

                    Portals go brrr. Everyday you will receive a varying amount of personal portals on your map. There are 3 tiers of portal which increase both the difficulty and reward (higher tier personal portals are level gated but can be accessed via party system). Inside you will fight 3 waves of mobs with various weaknesses and strengths. As mentioned earlier you can use the recruitment tab to post your portal or access others if you wish to target farms in specific material. Once the 3 waves have been cleared there is a chance a boss will spawn for bonus rewards, so do wait for the leave timer to come up before exiting.

                    <strong class="text-orange">Solo content that rewards Breakthrough Mats</strong><br>

                    By spending energy players can obtain beacons of which can be placed around the world to accumulate energy. Once a certain period of time has passed they open and players will receive rewards in their mail. Beacons can be placed anywhere in the world as long as it is not covered by a “roof” so try to find creative places to hide them. There is a chance every time you gain a beacon to receive a card which is used for a 'hide and seek' mini game. By clicking on the card you will be able to see a green circle on the map, by travelling there and clicking the card again 3 images will be shown instead. Once you approach the area shown on the card you will see a glimmer similar in colour to your card which you can now use to unlock the cache. The tiers of beacon/card from lowest to highest are: blue, purple and yellow, with the rewards scaling with the tier. The general loot pool is exp cards (chip and weapon) and weapon materials of any tier.

                    <strong class="text-orange">Solo dungeon that rewards selectable Breakthrough Mats</strong><br>

                    In Spacetime Domain you run through a random ruin but there are no chests present, your objective is just to clear within 20 minutes. Every stage ends with a boss fight, fights tend to be relatively easy as you have most likely fought them before. The rewards are weapon material crates and weapon exp cards along with a little exp. It is a solo activity so you will not be able to run it with other players.

                    Unique overworld dungeons ranging from A-01 to E-03, each with 3 difficulties. The first few will give you Relics that you can then use in the overworld. Ruins are unlocked by leveling up, and the first time doing a specific ruin will require you to enter from the overworld entrance, after which they can be quickly entered through the dungeon menu. Ruins can only be cleared one time, but can be re-entered at any time.

                    Clear endless stages of enemies and compete with other players within your (randomly generated) ranking bracket. Random weapons are buffed, changing every 5 stages. Every 5th stage is a boss. First time floor clear rewards include Dark Crystals. Weekly rewards are sent to your mailbox based on your ranking within the bracket. At weekly reset, your current floor will be reset down to the closest multiple of ten, i.e. from 79 to 70. The enemies on each floor will also be changed at weekly reset.<br>
                    <img src="images/cn.svg"> Some other modes were added within Bygone Phantasm, and doing all 3 will boost your total ranking score.

                    Clear 15 waves of enemies within the time limit (starts once you activate the lever). The run is also consumed once you activate the lever so don't try to reset after starting. Every third wave is a single boss enemy--clear the boss within the timer to unlock a chest that will payout rewards at the end. You will get 1 run on Tues/Thurs/Sat, and can hold up to 3 runs. Frontier Clash has dungeon-wide resistance effects on a random element each day. A damage boost buff is applied for every guild member in the party.<br>

                    Defeat enemies in the first stage to collect buffs (blue pyramid icons) and keys (drops from Hellamanders). After 3 keys are obtained, you can challenge the boss. Buffs have a set effect that can be activated upon obtaining 3 copies of that buff. Additionally, a team-wide buff is applied to everyone for each member that has activated a set effect. The buff menu in the bottom left is where you can transfer buffs, request buffs, and see how many are remaining. The dungeon has 2 effects that randomize each day--they apply to both the players and the enemies.

                    <strong class="text-orange">Solo dungeon that rewards Crystal Dust</strong><br>

                    An 8-stage solo dungeon where you collect buffs (blue pyramid icons) from enemies and fight bosses on stage 4 and 8. Various buffs can be obtained and have a set effect at 4 copies. Healing is greatly reduced--however it is still viable to heal up before boss stages. Hunting stages will have some timer extenders and possibly buffs on the ground. Buffs are obtained from defeating elite monsters, each adding 25% stage completion. Regular mobs can drop a small heal and slightly charge stage completion. Note that clearing a stage kills all enemies on your screen--you can gather elites when at a high completion % and kill one to receive buffs from all of them.<br>
                    <br>
                    Each Constellation (Lv 40, Lv 50, Lv 60 version) of Wormhole has 24 stages. Once you clear stage 8 (one lap), all buffs get reset and you start at stage 1 again (with harder enemies and a higher reward), up to 3 times (one circuit). Each Wormhole Constellation can only be cleared once. Every 4 days you will receive a reward amount in your mailbox based on how far you cleared the latest Constellation. Every 8 stages cleared will also give you a free box and a purchasable box in the shop with some useful items.

                    Fight against Apophis in a room. There is no shield to break, just damage the boss without dying--it hits hard and can easily one-shot top geared players. Use the Omnium Handcannon relic to consistently block Apophis' spirit bomb attack. There is a strategy where you use Zero's Discharge skill for invincibility with Couant's 5th awakening and Barbarossa matrices to damage reflect the spirit bomb, but it requires you to stay alive and wait in the dungeon for 15 minutes for Apophis to enrage (thus doing more damage). The attack's damage was nerfed so you can't one shot the boss with this.

                    Fight Frigg in one dimension and Valkyrie in another dimension. These bosses have to be killed within 30 seconds of each other to clear, otherwise they will reset to full HP. As Valkyrie is the more dangerous option, it's recommended to have all 8 players bring Frigg down to about 50% HP on the last HP bar, then leave one person to kite her while the other 7 kill Valkyrie. Frigg can easily be kited at a range where she will chase you around the map but cannot attack you.

                    Defeat both copies of Nemesis--red and yellow. The two bosses will heal each other if they are near each other, thus the recommended strategy is to rotate around the left side of the map and have one person use a bow charged shot to pull one boss into the left outer ring of the map. When successfully separated, the two bosses are relatively easy to defeat on their own. Killing the first boss will respawn any dead players.

                <h2><strong>Getting Started</strong></h2>
                1) Accept the quest in the "Event/Reward Box" menu on the top of your screen. You need to collect 10x Developer Logs <a href="https://static-web.ghzs.com/cspage_pro/huantaMap.html#">Interactive Map Here</a>. This will unlock the Housing menu to travel to your Home Island.
                <br><br>

                2) To build on your Home Island, you will need 1170 exploration points on Artificial Island (inner region only).
                <h2 class="mt-4"><strong>Construction</strong></h2>
                While on your Home Island, you can construct and upgrade buildings that generate materials over time. These materials are used in upgrading buildings, and also act as a currency in the housing shop where you can buy limited banner matrix pulls, avatars and avatar frames, Relic fragments, and can also be used to craft SSR matrices.<br>
                <br>
                The main source of materials is killing creatures on your Artificial Island, including not only animals and normal mobs, but also weakened world bosses. The higher the status of the creature (regular / elite / boss), the more materials will drop from it.<br>
                <br>
                ✦ Animals, regular enemies, and world bosses all respawn at weekly reset.<br>
                <br>
                ✦ Different creatures will drop different materials, but world bosses drop a large amount of all resources at once<br>
                <br>
                ✦ By upgrading buildings (except for the Development Center), you will increase the number of your workers and, accordingly, the amount of resources they extract. The development center must be upgraded to raise the max level of other buildings.<br>

                    <h2><strong>Versions</strong></h2>

                    Tower of Fantasy in China has a few different versions.<br>
                    The client you choose to register for will determine what information you need to provide, which servers you will play on, and what devices you can play on. <strong>You cannot directly play with players from other servers.</strong> You may come across them indirectly through random matchmaking, though its possible not all servers are connected this way.<br><br>

                    The Perfect World Games client is the official version, with three other redistributions by Bilibili, Huawei, and QooApp.<br>
                    <strong>Android versions can be played on PC with a 64-bit emulator</strong>, such as LDPlayer and MuMu Player.<br>
                    Below you can view the various registration methods for each client, with their requirements and supported devices.

                        We highly recommended that you connect your account to an email and password for security—if you used a publicly available phone number, your account could be stolen. Add them through the Douliu app as mentioned in the guides, and it will be bound to your <a href="https://i.laohu.com/">Laohu</a> account, so you can login to the game using an email and password instead of phone number and password. Laohu also lets you see your purchases.<br><br>
                        
                        Note: We don't provide guides for registering for the PWG client through QQ, WeChat, or Perfect World Passport as they additionally require a <strong>Chinese</strong> phone number.

                        (For emulator users: Only LD player 64 bit & newest version of MuMu works)<br><br>

                        <h3><strong>Step 1</strong></h3>
                        Download and install the <a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/en/mobileservices/appgallery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Huawei Gallery app</a><br>

                        <h3><strong>Step 2</strong></h3>
                        Launch the app and continue with account registration by pressing the "Me" icon on the home page.<br>
                        <strong><u>Don't swap region before the registration process!</u></strong><br>
                        In here you need to enter an email address, password and phone number.<br>

                        <h3><strong>Step 3</strong></h3>
                        Once successfully logged in, continue on the "Me" page and press the "settings page".<br>
                        Press the "Country/Region" option and change your country to China. This will restart the app in Chinese.<br>

                        <h3><strong>Step 4</strong></h3>

                    <h3><strong>Step 2</strong></h3>
                    Using the search bar at the top of the app, search for "TourPass". You will need to provide the information requested for verification, such as Passport ID and realname + pictures.<br><br>
                    
                    <h3><strong>Step 3</strong></h3>
                    Only Mastercard or Visa bank cards can be added from foreign banks. After adding a card you're all set! Tap "Top Up" and you can use your card to add prepaid balance to TourPass. Note the fees and minimum amount of 100 CNY per top up.<br><br>
