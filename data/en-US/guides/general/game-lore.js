                    <h3>Space Pioneering Era</h3>
                    {/* Aida Planet */}
                    <p>In 2316, humans discovered the extraterrestrial habitable planet "Aida".</p>

                    {/* Interstellar Colony */}
                    <p>In 2339, the spacecraft Yuanwang departed from Earth and headed for the unknown deep space.</p>

                    {/* Successfully Arrived */}
                    <p>In 2547, the first humans successfully arrived at "Aida".</p>

                    <h3>Interstellar Colonization Plan</h3>
                    {/* Civilization Establishment */}
                    <p>The first colonists established settlements, and the government adopted a federal system. At that time, the city was booming with high-rise buildings.</p>

                    {/* Comet Mara */}
                    <p>In 2653, the Aida authorities discovered the comet “Mara” and verified that a new energy source, "Omnium", could be obtained from this comet. The Old Federation launched the "Sky Slayer/Prism" project to build a Tower of Fantasy to solve the energy crisis.</p>

                    {/* Mirror Capitol */}
                    <p>In 2657, the Tower of Fantasy #7 and the Mirror Capitol were successfully constructed.</p>

                    {/* Tower of Fantasy */}
                    <p>In 2659 the Tower of Fantasy was built, and a directional force field was generated to capture the comet Mara, making it a satellite of planet Aida, and humans began to use the Omnium.</p>

                    {/* The Storage Cistern IV */}
                    <p>In 2661, the Storage Cistern IV for Omnium was produced, which can be used to stabilize the Omnium.</p>

                    {/* Primordial Radiation */}
                    <p>The leakage of the Omnium has caused the local ecology to mutate.</p>

                    {/* Calamity */}
                    <p>Five years later, at 4:47 pm on January 19th 2664, the Omnium reactor in the middle of the Tower of Fantasy exploded, and a large amount of Omnium was thrown into the atmosphere, spreading its radiation to the world and causing a global ecological disaster.</p>

                    {/* Tower of Fantasy #7 Destroyed */}
                    <p>In the decades after the Great Cataclysm, the Tower of Fantasy #7 was rebuilt and expanded many times. The repair work continued until 2678, and its function has not been restored so far. There are preset residential areas, scientific research areas, industrial areas and storage areas.</p>

                    {/* "Second City" Program */}
                    <p>In 2667, because the surface of Vera wasn't habitable anymore, about 90,000 survivors were accommodated in Mirror Capitol, and management regulations were issued at the same time. In 2668, the second city plan was officially implemented, and the early construction was completed. 20,000 Tower of Fantasy residents began to move, and it is still expanding today.</p>

                    <h3>Cataclysm</h3>

                    {/* Hykros */}
                    <p>In 2665, in order to cope with the cataclysm, the surviving scientific researchers established "Hykros". There is also some information showing that Hykros was established before the cataclysm.</p>

                    {/* Butterfly Engraving */}
                    <p>On June 17th 2665, Dr. Barekov takes over the “Butterfly Engraving” project from Dr. Nathan, resuming it on June 22nd. Dr. Barekov conducted a series of secret experiments about biological mutations to give birth to the Aberrant Franken.</p>
                    <p>On July 13th a spiral structure was found in the images of a subject's brain, but it wasn't certain whether this was triggered by the butterfly reagent.</p>
                    <p>On September 24th several subjects were put under high Omnium radiation, finding out the cell production rate had increased significantly.</p>

                    {/* Engraving Theory */}
                    <p>On December 12nd 2665, it was tested if performing extraction and injection of the consciousness was possible using a symbiont as the new body. The symbiont showed minor responses to the Omnium radiation, whereas the person continued to show violent convulsions. After the transferring process, consciousness was detected in the symbiont for some minutes, for then disappearing.</p>

                    {/* Moses' Experiment */}
                    <p>In 2666, Vulkan was born. Aberration tests were carried out with a live cat, named Apophis , but ultimately failed.</p>

                    {/* Suppressor First Draft */}
                    <p>In 2667, Dr. Vasika and Dr. Chereh, after two failures, jointly developed the “Suppressor scheme version 3” against Omnium radiation using living organisms. The experimental group used a living person named Julliard to inject G-67 virus to test whether the suppressor was effective and finally succeeded, creating Aberrant Seraphim.</p>

                    {/* Finished Product */}
                    <p>In 2668, the "suppressor" was successfully developed. By wearing this micro-device, Aida humans gained the ability to radiate antigen energy.</p>

                    {/* Back in Time */}
                    <p>Under the leadership of Dr. Claire, Hykros repeatedly tried time-travel more than 3,000 times, and it continues to this day.</p>

                    {/* Mirror Capital */}
                    <p>In 2670, the first SP-77 suit passed the test and set foot on Vera again.</p>

                    {/* Silver Coast Research Station */}
                    <p>Construction began in 2681, with the intention of restarting research such as the time-space engine project.</p>

                    {/* Environmental Improvement Program */}
                    <p>In 2689, in order to solve the problem of population expansion and resources, Wei Na, the then-executive officer, started the "Environmental Transformation Program" to restore the ecology so that the resettlement measures could be carried out smoothly. In the same year, the anti-gravity engine was put into service.</p>

                    {/* Resident Emigration */}
                    <p>In 2695, the Environmental Improvement Program achieved results, and some residents of the Tower of Fantasy moved out.</p>

                    {/* New Executive */}
                    <p>In 2698, Wei Na stepped down as executive officer due to health reasons, and was handed over to Qingxin to succeed.</p>

                    {/* Heirs of Aida Established */}
                    <p>In 2671, "Heirs of Aida" was established by Sage and Zeke's father. This organization believes Hykros uses the suppressors to control people and it has the objective to expose their greed.</p>

                    <h3>Half a year ago</h3>

                    {/* Polluted Area */}
                    <p>In 2712, two Hykros Executors were ambushed by Sage while on a mission and one of them was hunted down by the Aberrant hound "Barbarossa". During their escape, the suppressor was damaged and they fell into a coma, allowing Frigg to capture them with her team and take them to Sage, who implanted a virus in their suppressors.</p>

                <h3>Astra</h3>
                {/* Astra Island Refuge */}
                <p>After some time, you woke up in the Astra Shelter and found out that you were rescued by Shirli and Zeke.</p>

                {/* Malfunction Repair */}
                <p>There is something wrong with the equipment in the shelter. In order to reduce the burden on her brother (who is also the leader of the Astra Island shelter), Shirli decides to go with you to repair the equipment.</p>

                {/* Ravagers Assault */}
                <p>Something went wrong during the repair, causing enemies to invade the shelter.</p>
