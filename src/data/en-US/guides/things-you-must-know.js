In either case, shields reduce the damage you deal to the enemy and usually there are some juicy shield break buffs and effects that are worth pursuing, so switch to your shield break weapon and mash that left click. "

        header: "13. Tap Revive",
        text: "Fallen teammates can be revived by interacting with their limping body. However, *you can actually just tap the interact key and dash away*, and they will still be revived. This is a superior way of reviving players as you are able to continue fighting, are less vulnerable to enemy attacks, and can quickly revive multiple players. No need to stand around waiting for the revive to finish."

That will attach your current coordinates to the message and instantly send it--other players can click on these coords to see where you are on the world map. If you're asking for help or guiding someone, it can come in handy."

            `On Cetus island go straight past the tent in the middle and there will be an arcade machine near Slayer. You can play the claw machine 3 times a day and earn gifts that raise simulacra affinity/friendship. The prizes you can get are fixed, but the purple fox is a purple tier gift. I'm not sure if the black robot cat (another purple tier) is even grabbable as it always slips out of the claw.  
            &nbsp;  
            Another opportunity for free gifts is at the NPC Hopkins, found at the Black Market (near the world boss Apophis). Speak to him and you will be presented with a choice between two mystery boxes. There is a chance of getting purple tier gifts from this daily. `
