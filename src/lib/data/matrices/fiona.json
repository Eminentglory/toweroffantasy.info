If you have Benediction Resonance, the final damage buff is reduced to **14%/16%/18%/20%** but applies to your teammates as well. Receive an additional (base ATK/10000)% final damage increase based on your ATK, up to **5%**. This effect works in the background, and if multiple sets are used, the highest star set will take effect."
