## Getting Started
Accept the quest by clicking the Present icon in the top right.  
Collect 10 Developer Logs [IMAGE]() . This will unlock a button in the menu to visit your Home Island.
To build on your Home Island, you will need 1170 Exploration Points on Artificial Island (innder region only).

## Construction
While on your Home Island, you can construct and upgrade buildings that generate materials over time. These materials are used for three things: 
1. Upgrading buildings to generate more materials*
2. Currency in the housing shop (Limited Matrix pulls, Avatars, Relic fragments..)
3. Crafting SSR Matrices

**The Development Center must be upgraded to raise the max level of other buildings.*

### Material Drops
Materials also drop from creatures on your island, including animals, normal mobs, and weakened world bosses. The higher the status of the creature (regular / elite / boss), the more materials will drop from it.

**All creatures respawn at weekly reset.** Different creatures will drop different materials, but world bosses drop a large amount of all resources at once
